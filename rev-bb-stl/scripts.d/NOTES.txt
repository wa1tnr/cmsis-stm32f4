Any files named something__FREEZE are meant to be copied over to
the same filename, minus the last part ('__FREEZE') for daily use
(if wanted/needed).

The purpose is to have an older or stable version checked into
the repository, while permitting more recent edits to be present,
but not checked in.

It is a nuisance to have them present that way, so the work-around
is to git mv oldfile oldfile__FREEZE to clear the git status of
nagging unimportant edit notices.
